With an award-winning combination of photos, facts, and fun, NG KIDS has captivated its more than one million readers for over 35 years. Articles and departments entertain and inspire readers to learn about their world with amazing information about animals, science, technology, archaeology, geography, and pop culture, plus jokes, games, activities in every issue.", "Amazon.com Review", "National Geographic Kids magazine is aimed at young readers from six years and up who want to find out more about the world around them. The magazine contains a superb blend of photos, fun facts, and articles presented in a cheery style, making it perfect for keeping kids' attention. National Geographic Kids magazine has been presenting information to kids in an accessible way for over thirty-five years.  You can expect the same kind of subjects to be included in National Geographic Kids magazine that you get in the adult version-animals, science, archaeology, and geography-but with technology and pop culture added to the mix too. As you might expect, there is also a strong emphasis on magnificent wildlife photography. Frequent appearances of animal posters can be found within the pages, as well as high-quality photographs sprinkled throughout the magazine. The addition of games and jokes, alongside other activities such as puzzles and competitions, keeps the subjects light, while still getting across the important facts.  Your children can explore ancient civilizations on one page, come face-to-face with exotic wildlife on another, and turn the next page to a make and do project, which is often perfect for homework.

In the 1990s, it went through a change to a harder-core format, but since 2005 has come back to its roots of soft-core pornography and erotica.  Columns in Penthouse magazine feature lots of sexually-explicit content and pictures of women designed to delight men. The famous Penthouse Forum, which publishes explicit letters from readers, is still a monthly feature. Several explicit pictorials run every month, some focusing on a specific model and others featuring several models around a theme like women with all-natural bodies or women from the military. A centerfold and accompanying pictorial features that month's Penthouse Pet. Other articles include interviews with Penthouse Pets, longer articles about sex-themed topics like sex museums and the BDSM world, and sexual adventure stories.  Penthouse magazine is not all about sex, though. Men will also find technology and fashion well-covered throughout each month's issue. Buying guides help you find the best electronics, toys, and man-themed gifts. Full Frontal, a monthly featured column, covers entertainment including gaming, movies, and DVDs. Other male indulgences like great scotch or premium cigars are frequent topics of discussion, as are hunting, fast cars, and sports.  Ultimately, Penthouse magazine is designed for men who aren't afraid to be men.

Special Issues Included in Your Subscription:  Each July, the Food & Wine Best New Chefs are announced -- naming ten up-and-coming rising stars in the culinary world. Past Best New Chefs include notables such as Daniel Boulud, Tom Colicchio, Todd English and Thomas Keller. The October issue focuses on wine, revealing the winners of Food & Wine's American Wine Awards.   Magazine Layout:  The pages of Food & Wine are designed in a contemporary style. Recipes are easy to read and the instructions have been tested so they are complete and easy to follow. Feature stories are accompanied by beautiful, mouth-watering photographs.   Contributors: Contributors are chosen for their knowledge of and passion for the culinary lifestyle, including luminaries in the restaurant world, such as Jacques Pepin and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, to cookbook authors, expert wine-makers and food artisans.  Past Issues:  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  Food & Wine is not just a compilation of recipes, but rather covers the entire range of topics of interest for our sophisticated readers: profiles of chefs (from the luminaries of the restaurant world to the up-and-coming chefs who are the superstars of tomorrow), travel destinations explored through their tastes and flavors, and expert advice about the best buys in wine (from the most worthwhile splurges to great bargains) and wine pairings.  Advertisers:  Most of the advertising in Food & Wine is specific to the culinary interests of its readers: including food products and ingredients, kitchen equipment, wine merchants, and destination travel advertisements.  Awards:  The James Beard Foundation has honored Food & Wine many times over the years, for journalism about the restaurant industry, emerging food trends, and wine coverage. Food & Wine also was the Gold Winner of the 2008 Folio Eddie Award, for the September 2007 anniversary issue. The Food & Wine Classic in Aspen is America's premier culinary event. Hailed by the New York Times as \"the granddaddy of them all\", the event features three incomparable days of cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, seminars and panel discussions by world-class talent, such as Jacques Pepin, Bobby Flay, Emeril Lagasse, Mario Batali, and Danny Meyer. Food & Wine is also proud to be a sponsor of Bravo's Top Chef. Amazon.com Review  Focusing on a central theme in each issue, such as 25 party ideas (number 25: nautical party) or 35 quick and tasty dishes, Food & Wine indulges a broad range of culinary connoisseurs and thirsty enophiles. Expect a number of well-rounded recipes and festive commentary on the theme at hand, but don't expect that Food & Wine will be weighed down by said theme--each issue also contains a home shopping guide (in case you need to know where to purchase a green bamboo tray), restaurant reviews, a Drinks/Wine section, and shorter articles that run from \"Win a Date with a Chef\" to \"The Joy of Slow Cooking.\" --A.J.

Established in 1843 to campaign against the protectionist corn laws, The Economist remains, in the second half of its second century, true to the liberal principles of its founder. James Wilson, a hat maker from the small Scottish town of Hawick, believed in free trade, internationalism and minimum interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market. The Economist also takes a fiercely independent stance on social issues, from gay marriage to the legalisation of drugs, but its main service to its readers is as a global newspaper: To uncover new ideas from all around the world. The Kindle Edition of The Economist contains all of the articles and graphics found in the print edition, but will not include all photos.

A signature mix of politics, world affairs, business, science, arts and letters attracts millions who come to The New Yorker to be informed, to be surprised, to laugh, and to be moved. Recent issues have included Hendrik Hertzberg on the Clinton and Obama showdown; Margaret Talbot on talking animals; James Surowiecki on the Bear Stearn's collapse; David Sedaris on smoking; and fiction by Annie Proulx. Past Issues:  Contributors: Among The New Yorker staff writers, Ken Auletta, who covers the media business and is an authority on the communications industry, is the author of 9 books, including the best-seller Three Blind Mice: How the TV Networks Lost Their Way. Seymour M. Hersh has written for The New Yorker since 1971. He has won numerous awards including the Pulitzer Prize for his investigations into the My Lai massacre, and is the author of eight books, including Chain of Command. The legendary John McPhee, on staff since 1965, teaches writing at Princeton. Jerome Groopman is a Harvard Medical School professor and the author of over 150 scientific articles. His latest book, The Anatomy of Hope, was a best-seller.  Magazine Layout: The New Yorker is a readers' magazine. Articles range from short Talk of the Town pieces to in-depth explorations of politics and world affairs. Short reviews of restaurants, movies and the arts in Goings On About Town can be quickly skimmed, while, at the back of the book, longer, richer reviews of selected books, plays and movies can be read at a more leisurely pace. And the dozen or so cartoons in each issue offer their sheer wit and entertainment.  Comparisons to Other Magazines:  The New Yorker offers the long-form journalism that has all but disappeared in today's media landscape. New Yorker writers are not bound by daily deadlines, and it is not uncommon for them to spend months working on an article. Nor are the writers constrained by a mandated point of view. They are free to follow a story wherever it leads.  Advertising:  Advertisers include financial service companies, car-makers, luxury goods purveyors, hotels, publishers, and arts events. Small ads throughout the magazine offer a boutique-style shopping experience for everything from customized jewelry and Panama hats, to expedition ship cruises and villa rentals.  Awards:  The New Yorker is the most-honored magazine in publishing history. It has won 48 National Magazine Awards, the magazine world's equivalent of the Oscars. Its contributors have won many of the major awards, including The Nobel prize and The Pulitzer prize. In 2008, two of the Pulitzer-Prize winning books included work that originally appeared in The New Yorker: The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz won the fiction prize and Time and Materials by Robert Hass won for poetry.  Amazon.com Review:  Founded in 1925, The New Yorker hardly changed for its first 60 years, both in its dry, type-heavy design and in its reputation as a writer's and reader's haven. In 1987 it was on only its second editor when management decided to shake things up. A rocky decade ensued, but The New Yorker is now back at the top of its game under David Remnick's editorship. Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that's both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. The New Yorker's weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it's as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal. --Nicholas H.

Comparisons to Other Magazines  Subscriber-supported since 1991, Motorcycle Consumer News is the only non-commercial motorcycle magazine in the U.S. Unlike some other magazines, this publication doesn't specialize in one type of bike or riding style to the exclusion of everything else. And instead of page after page of ad clutter, there is no outside advertising to get in the way of the wealth of useful information in every issue.

Established in 1843 to campaign against the protectionist corn laws, The Economist remains, in the second half of its second century, true to the liberal principles of its founder. James Wilson, a hat maker from the small Scottish town of Hawick, believed in free trade, internationalism and minimum interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market. The Economist also takes a fiercely independent stance on social issues, from gay marriage to the legalisation of drugs, but its main service to its readers is as a global newspaper: To uncover new ideas from all around the world.", "Amazon.com Review", "Anyone wanting to stay up-to-date on the latest national and world news will find The Economist magazine invaluable. Each issue contains detailed articles to satisfy every interest, including topics such as current affairs, the latest political climate, business affairs, and economics. In addition, it frequently features articles in areas such as science or technology to provide those perspectives, and also includes country-specific information because the state of countries such as China directly impact the rest of the world.  For readers who are interested in the latest news on art, entertainment, political, and world news, The Economist magazine also regularly includes book and movie reviews. Having such a well-rounded depth of content is one of the reasons it is one of the most popular current affairs magazines in circulation today.  The Economist magazine is written in a concise manner to ensure that it provides the most detailed information available on each given subject in the limited amount of space provided. The magazine publishers know that their readers' time is valuable, and they want readers to be able to quickly get the information they need.  If you pride yourself on always being aware of the latest in world news, economics, and politics, and you want one resource in which you can easily access current information on these subjects and more, The Economist magazine can provide you with everything you need.
